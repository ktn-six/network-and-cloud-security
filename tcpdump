Basic Capture Options

Switch Command	Result
D	Will display any interfaces available to capture from.
i	Selects an interface to capture from. ex. -i eth0
n	Do not resolve hostnames.
nn	Do not resolve hostnames or well-known ports.
e	Will grab the ethernet header along with upper-layer data.
X	Show Contents of packets in hex and ASCII.
XX	Same as X, but will also specify ethernet headers. (like using Xe)
v, vv, vvv	Increase the verbosity of output shown and saved.
c	Grab a specific number of packets, then quit the program.
s	Defines how much of a packet to grab.
S	change relative sequence numbers in the capture display to absolute sequence numbers. (13248765839 instead of 101)
q	Print less protocol information.
r file.pcap	Read from a file.
w file.pcap	Write into a file



			Save our PCAP Output to a File
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ~/output.pcap

			Reading Output From a File
sudo tcpdump -r ~/output.pcap




Which tcpdump switch is used to show us all possible interfaces we can listen to?

tcpdump -D

tcpdump -i [interface name or #]



Disable name resolution and display relative sequence numbers for another challenge.

TONYNGENO@htb[/htb]$ tcpdump -i [interface name or #] -vX



Save a Capture to a .PCAP file.

tcpdump -i [interface name or #] -nvw [/path/of/filename.pcap]
tcp -i eth0 -w ~/name-of-file


Read the Capture from a .PCAP file.pcap

tcpdump -nnSXr [file/to/read.pcap]


tcpdump -r ~/name-of-file.pcap


What TCPDump switch will allow us to pipe the contents of a pcap file out to another function such as 'grep'?

-l


 If we wished to filter out ICMP traffic from our capture, what filter could we use? ( word only, not symbol please.)

not icmp




			Helpful TCPDump Filters
Filter	Result

host	host will filter visible traffic to show anything involving the designated host. Bi-directional 
	 sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 172.16.146.2

src / dest	src and dest are modifiers. We can use them to designate a source or destination host or port.
	sudo tcpdump -i eth0 src host 172.16.146.2

net	net will show us any traffic sourcing from or destined to the network designated. It uses / notation.
	sudo tcpdump -i eth0 dest net 172.16.146.0/24

proto	will filter for a specific protocol type. (ether, TCP, UDP, and ICMP as examples)
	sudo tcpdump -i eth0 proto 17
	
port	port is bi-directional. It will show any traffic with the specified port as the source or destination.
	 sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 443

portrange	portrange allows us to specify a range of ports. (0-1024)
	sudo tcpdump -i eth0 portrange 0-1024
	
less / greater "< >"	less and greater can be used to look for a packet or protocol option of a specific size.
	sudo tcpdump -i eth0 less 64
	
and / &&	and && can be used to concatenate two different filters together. for example, src host AND port.
	sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.0.1 and port 23

or	or allows for a match on either of two conditions. It does not have to meet both. It can be tricky.
	sudo tcpdump -r sus.pcap icmp or host 172.16.146.1

not	not is a modifier saying anything but x. For example, not UDP.
	sudo tcpdump -r sus.pcap not icmp
